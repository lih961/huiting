        <h1>Proposal for my final site</h1>
        <h2>I want to design a visual narrative website, and it could be part of my version portfolio site. My theme is about a Chinese ancient book, “shanhaijing”, that is also called “The Classic of Mountains and Seas”. It is the one that preserves the most materials of ancient mythology among the existing works. The Classic of Mountains and Seas, although with only more than 31000 words in all, is indeed all-encompassing. In addition to myths and legends, it also involves geography, history, religion, folklore, calendars, astronomy, animals, plants, minerals, medicine, anthropology, ethnology, geology and oceanography. This is a wonderful book, an encyclopedia of the daily life of the ancient people. The Classic of Mountains and Seas can indeed be called an "ancient wizard book" which preserves so many valuable materials of myths and legends. I want to start with The Classic of Mountains and Seas to explore the charm of Chinese mythology. I want to use illustration and visual elements to help to show some ridiculous but interesting story, and depend on these ancient myths, to design my garments related to my major.</h2>

            <h2>I love Raoul Gaillard’s website. Raoul Gaillard is a web developer and UI student at Hetic in Paris. His portfolio site shows off his coding smarts from the word go, with colourful, undulating geometric shapes making the transition between each page a delight for the user. I want to use the similar way to show my visual garments on the left and the text on the right side.</h2>
